# Big Int

Written program can create an integer with length of a 1000 (can be more if user changes the constant).

In `bigInt.h` there are defined different functions that can **add**, **substarct**, **multiply**, **devide** or **take module** from 2 *bigInt* numbers. The functions are realized in `bigInt.c`.

In `main.c` user is asked to type two numbers and and operation (e.g. 100 + 100). The numbers and operator must be seperated with a space.

`CMakeLists.txt` and `Makefile` are 2 different ways to run the program.
